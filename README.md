## Abstract
The invention pertains to blockchain based application or framework enter transactions in the blockchain network involving metadata regarding the generated document/transcript. When an issuing organization generates the original document (ex: University generating transcript), there must be a transaction on the blockchain recorded with data pertaining to the document generated (ex: hash value of the file after encryption). This framework requires the verifiers to be aware of the user credentials of the generator (ex: hiring company needs to know the unique wallet ID, or user ID in the blockchain to differentiate the real generator from a malicious user or scammer). When the verifier wants to verify if a document is legitimate or not, they can upload it to the application, where the application calculates the hash of submitted document and crosschecks it with the existing data stored in the blockchain.
